# Hello there! This strange concoction which you are viewing is my ePortfolio. 

This ePortfolio is about a program which I created in my CS 340 Client-Server course. I chose this project because it utilizes a culmination of concepts from past courses that best reflects my skills in software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. In other words, it best demonstrates my knowledge and competence in solving real world problems that deliver value. What is more, it is all my own. My goal is to demonstrate my skills and abilities in three areas: software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases.


The following is a code review that explains the code, analyzes the code for flaws and decides on a plan. (41m - I'll edit this down in the future)

Lets consider this a rough first draft. The plan initially is to improve the design by enhancing existing code, add to the complexity of the design by adding new features, and enhancing the database by performance-tuning it.
