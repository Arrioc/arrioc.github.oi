# Hello and Welcome! This ePortfolio features a program iteration with more to come! 
This ePortfolio is about a program I created in my CS 340 Client-Server course. I chose to enhance this project because it utilizes a culmination of concepts from past courses that best reflect my skills in software engineering, algorithms and thier data structures, and databases. 

## The following is a code review...
that explains the chosen project and its code, analyzes the code for flaws, and decides on a plan for enhancement. 
The video is 41m. I'd like to edit this down soon. It's a bit of a rough second draft. üòÖ

## The Plan
My plan for software engineering and design is to improve the software by creating more readable output, more user-friendly input, and a well-rounded 'update' module for the API which will help to deliver better value. I will also remove unused code, improve commenting and try to fix any bugs.

The plan for algorithms and data structures is to add to the complexity of the artifact by creating new algorithms. These algorithms will allow for internal and API module field deletion, internal document retrieval and a menu that allows users to select program services to run.

My plan for database enhancement is to utilize more advanced administrative methods to investigate and apply performance tuning on the database, with the end-goal of improving database efficiency by speeding up its reads and writes.

# The Artifact
  * The artifact I chose for enhancement is a representational state transfer (RESTful) webservice stack with an industry-standard interface that I created in my CS 340 Client-Server course six months ago. This program can perform queries and aggregations, reporting on documents in the database in numerous ways. It can also create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) documents for a stock broking company both internally and externally through a web service that utilizes the RESTful application programming interface (API).
 
# Artifact Rationale
  * I chose to enhance this project because it is a culmination of my understanding of past courses and best reflects my skills in software design and engineering in that it demonstrates my knowledge and competence in solving real world problems that deliver value. There are a dozen different algorithms, each within their own portable and reusable module, and they all interact with the MongoDB database. Perfect for showing off my skills in implementing algorithms and display database prowess. What is more, it is all my own in that it does not lean on someone else‚Äôs ability to design solutions to the problem.

# Collaboration
  * This artifact is the product of collaboration. Although I did create the program on my own, it took collaborating with peers, tutors, and instructors to for me to succeed. My peers and I in both the course‚Äôs discussion forum, and in SNHU‚Äôs Slack Chat for coders, helped each other progress. Tutors both from Slack Chat and our institution‚Äôs academic services assisted in helping me debug code and learn different ways to implement my ideas. Instructor feedback has broadened my understanding, and that has contributed to my work. The artifact also has the collaborative coding help site, Stack Overflow, to thank for its success.

# Software Design & Engineering

* ## Knowledge Acquisition
  * The MongoDB database shows that I understand how to import and manage a distributed database using appropriate MongoDB statements, such as creating simple and complex indexes. This is an important skill to have because ‚ÄúNoSQL databases like MongoDB are emerging as the next big thing‚Äù (Sriparasa & D‚Äômello, 2018, p. 136). This NoSQL database is fast, flexible, and scalable, and it provides tons of features that do not sacrifice speed (Chodorow, 2013, pp. 3-5). 

  * Both the internal and API modules show that I understand how to connect to the database and carry out simple and complex functions using the appropriate JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), a widely popular data interchange format (Sriparasa & D‚Äômello, 2018, p. 6). This is a critical skill to have because JSON is the go-to language for data interchange today (Sriparasa & D‚Äômello, 2018, pp. 6-7). The internal and API modules show that I understand how apply CRUD functions for MongoDB database documents, perform queries and aggregations, test the code, find solutions to problems using branches and loops, and perform exception handling. The API modules show that I understand how to create and test uniform resource identifiers (URI's) and locators (URL‚Äôs), and implement the use of a basic RESTful web service using a language-specific web service framework like Bottle to rout paths and perform connections. 

* ## Developing Solutions
  * I met the planned objectives for creating more readable output, more user-friendly input, and a well-rounded update module for the API which helps to deliver better value. The artifact now has improved readability by integrating JSON code into specific inputs and outputs, for any module that outputs data to the user. The artifact now has friendlier user input capability, by removing code that required the user to preformat their own inputs and injecting code that preformats the inputs for them using the JSON and Pymongo language. This allowed me to remove "bad formatting" error catch blocks. The API update module now better reflects the industry specific goal for update functionality by allowing the user to update any field in a specified document (not just the ‚Äúvolumes‚Äù field), or insert a new one, using the simple but effective solution of adding a variable to the CURL which is extracted and queried. I also added needed annotation comments to every module and fixed a bug for the API modules that would reprint the last response posted in the terminal as one exits. 

* ## Reflecting on the Process
  * As I worked to improve the API‚Äôs update program to accept any user field, after many failures, I began examining other examples of ways in which CURLS can be made. By observing in the ‚ÄústockReport‚Äù module that I was able to take a key variable ‚Äúarray‚Äù to input its value, an idea occurred to me. I could simply create a new ‚Äúkey‚Äù variable for the CURL whose value would be the embedded key and value which I wanted to extract. I applied the idea to the module, and it worked. 
  
  * As I worked to remove user formatting issues such as having the user input data in JSON or with quotes, I was faced with the challenge of needing to know exactly what the JSON utility, ‚Äúloads‚Äù, and ‚Äúdumps‚Äù were doing to the input code. I researched ‚Äúloads‚Äù and ‚Äúdumps‚Äù to refresh my memory and found a great site that explains specifically what they do. Loads turns strings into JSON objects, and dumps turns JSON objects into strings (Educative, Inc., 2021). Understanding ‚Äúloads‚Äù and ‚Äúdumps‚Äù allowed me format input for the user, simplifying thier tasks. This understanding also helped me my next task- fixing output readability.
  
  * I almost gave up creating more readable output because sites like StackOverflow repeatedly siad it was not possible (Stack Exchange Inc, 2015). Help-site opinions are not always accurate. Sometimes it helps to ignore opinions and dive deeper. For me, it helped to study an old exercise (a ‚Äútimestamp‚Äù module) whose output to the terminal looked ideal. The code used ‚Äúloads‚Äù before printing, and then use ‚Äúdumps‚Äù along with some commands inside the print statement. Inside the print parentheses, after the string or variable to print, one can write ‚Äúindent=4, default=json_util.default.‚Äù This indents the data, making it more exposed and orderly. I then applied this knowledge to every module that outputs data, including the API (for future developers). I then made a post about my discovery to StackOverflow, for future questioners like myself. Since then, someone edited it to look nicer using color coding and highlighting, which I was surprised to see.

# Algorithms and Data Structures
* ## Knowledge Acquisition
  * This artifact showcases a diverse collection of skills and abilities in using algorithms and data structures to perform useful database manipulations that meet the client‚Äôs needs. The artifact makes use of dictionaries, arrays, methods, functions, calls, conditional branches, expressions, statements, returns, formatting, dot-notation, and input/output using a combination of the MongoDB, Pymongo and Bottle languages and commands. The API modules show that I can create and test uniform resource identifiers (URL‚Äôs) and implement a basic RESTful web service using a language-specific web service frameworks, like Bottle, to rout paths and perform connections. 

  * The ‚Äúcreate‚Äù programs utilize dictionary data structures internally. It also uses dictionaries externally by in using the bottle framework for a web service. This design choice better synchronizes with MongoDB‚Äôs dictionary-based storage design because dictionaries utilize mapping that allows indices of (almost) any type (Downey, 2015, p. 103). Python dictionaries also use hashtables which search in constant time and are high performance in that they cut down search time considerably (Downey, 2015, pp. 205-207). Also present in the ‚ÄúAPIstockReport‚Äù is the use of an array for a data structure, returning multiple documents to the user. The module ‚Äústocks_read2‚Äù utilizes a reverse lookup by finding existing industries (a value) and returning their dictionary key/values for tickers in an array (Downey, 2015, p. 106). 

  * Modules like ‚Äústocks_read‚Äù utilize methods, functions, and branches with and without conditional statements to solve a problem. These modules make use of a ‚Äúmain‚Äù method which take the input from a user and then use statements that format input (and possible projections) to conduct a search of the database using a query. After checking for formatting errors or whether the query exists, the main method calls an execution function in the module. This function carries out the search or conducts calculations (in the case of ‚Äústocks_read1‚Äù) using parameters. These modules often use MongoDB dot-notation shell methods like ‚Äú.count()‚Äù to check for a criteria‚Äôs existence (using conditional branches) and then prints data from the execution function. The pointer then returns to main, and the program exits. 

  * Modules that ‚Äúupdate‚Äù and ‚Äúdelete‚Äù are much the same in structure as the ‚Äúread‚Äù modules but differ in that their main methods take returns from called functions and perform condition checks using Pymongo‚Äôs dot-notation. I find notation like ‚Äú.raw_result‚Äù very handy because it can tell me if the changes made were really carried out on the database, and this might contradict my print statements which helps to point out flaws in the code. 

  * Some modules that search the database do a bit more than simply output documents. These use MongoDB commands to apply functionality. For example, the module ‚Äústocks_read1‚Äù performs calculations on all ‚Äú50-Day Simple Moving Average‚Äù values, and ‚Äústocks_read2‚Äù will match all values for the key ‚Äúindustry‚Äù. Functions, such as the ‚ÄúAPIindustryReport‚Äù and ‚Äústocks_read3‚Äù modules, provide a valuable service to the business through aggregation which allows them to analyze and crunch data in interesting ways (Chodorow, 2013, p. 127). These modules use MongoDB‚Äôs ability to calculate, match and project data combined with the ability to aggregate data (group, sort, skip, and limit data) to present the data in a more useful way (Chodorow, 2013, p. 127).

* ## Reflecting on the Process
  * The read module was simple because I had done this sort of things many times before. The module that deletes fields was a new challenge. It helped to study my "delete" and "update" module‚Äôs code. Browsing through what ‚Äúdelete_one‚Äù can do in the online MongoDB documentation, I saw that this only applied to whole objects like documents. This reassured me that what I wanted to do was modify the document using ‚Äúupdate_one‚Äù. I refreshed myself on MongoDB‚Äôs ‚Äú$set‚Äù which resides in my update module. It updates existing keys or creates new ones. Realizing that I want the opposite of this, I began browsing through my MongoDB book and rediscovered ‚Äú$unset‚Äù which does the opposite of ‚Äú$set‚Äù. The end-product is a marriage between my ‚Äúdelete‚Äù and ‚Äúupdate‚Äù module.

  * My biggest challenge for the menu was to figure out how to execute my modules from inside the menu. After much searching, I decided to ask for help. A tutor on Slack Chat hinted that one way I can execute my modules is by importing them but did not say how (they never do). I tried importing a module at the top of my code and I noticed that it would run my imported module before executing my menu. After that, I knew what to do: put the import lines with the menu options. The API modules are different, they can‚Äôt be started using the imports. After a bit of searching, I learned from a help site on Unix\Linux called NixCraft that I could import the ‚Äúos‚Äù and use ‚Äúos.system(‚Äúcommand‚Äù)‚Äù to execute my API‚Äôs (Vivec, 2013). I added these lines to my menu options for each API module. I also learned through trial and error that my internal Python files need to be in the directory with the REST API to have the menu fully functional.
